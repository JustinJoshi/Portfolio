## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this portfolio with a minimalist design approach, focusing on clean typography and straightforward layout. The homepage features an "About Me" section highlighting my transition from operations management at a wellness retreat to software engineering, and showcases InvoiceIQ as my flagship project.

The site uses semantic HTML for accessibility and SEO, making it discoverable by recruiters. Navigation is simple and intuitive. The entire site is fully responsive across all devices. I kept the color scheme professional with good contrast for readability and avoided heavy frameworks to ensure fast load times.

## Optimizations

I could implement lazy loading for images to improve initial page load performance as more projects are added.

Adding a dark mode toggle with CSS variables and localStorage would enhance UX and persist user preferences across sessions.

A blog section would improve SEO through fresh content and demonstrate continuous learning.

Implementing analytics would provide insights into which projects get the most attention and inform future content decisions.

Adding scroll animations with Intersection Observer API would create subtle visual interest without compromising performance.

## Lessons Learned:

This project taught me the value of simplicity in design. Less is often more when presenting professional work. I learned to write copy that's conversational yet professional, making the site approachable for both technical and non-technical audiences.

Building without frameworks reinforced my vanilla JavaScript fundamentals and showed me how much you can accomplish with modern CSS. Performance optimization became second nature - every asset matters when you're trying to make a great first impression.

I learned that a portfolio is never "done" - it's a living document that grows with your skills. The key is launching with something solid rather than waiting for perfection.
